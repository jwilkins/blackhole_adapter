I was curious what the minimum implementation for ActiveRecord was.

So I poked around in active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter and
in the SQLite adapter and came up with this.

If you set your adapter to 'blackhole' you can do the following:


  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

  puts User.count
  # SQL (0.000277)   SELECT count(*) AS count_all FROM users
  # => 0
